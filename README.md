# camera_calibrator
A tool for calibrating cameras - a wrapper for the cv2 camera calibration functions.

Quite simply take a bunch of images in a folder located at 'root' point the script to it, provided the grid params 
(size num rows/cols) as well and it'll chug through and pump out some calibrations for you.

Enjoy!
